description: Use when implementing repository UI code from a Figma URL, frame, component, selected node, or active Figma selection. Requires Figma design context access, screenshot capture, variables/assets when exposed, project component mapping, and visual parity validation. Does not write to Figma.

# Figma Design To Code

Use this skill only when the deliverable is code in the repository that matches a
Figma design. Figma canvas writes, node creation, and design mutation are out of
scope; route those to official Figma tools or plugins when installed.

Source attribution: this replaces the prior Figma implementation skill while
retaining Figma Developer Terms attribution in `LICENSE.txt`.

## Effect

When this skill fires, implementation should be constrained by Figma evidence:
design context, screenshot, variables, assets, component metadata, and project
component mapping. The result should be repository-native code with explicit
visual parity validation, not a fresh UI concept inspired by the design.

## Preconditions

- Figma design-context access is available.
- The user provides a Figma URL, frame/component/node identifier, or an active
  Figma desktop selection exposed through the tool.
- The project codebase can be inspected so implementation uses local framework,
  components, tokens, routing, and asset conventions.

If design context or screenshot access is unavailable, report `blocked` and ask
for an exported screenshot/spec or for the Figma tool to be connected. Do not
guess from a URL alone.

Stop and report `blocked` when the Figma URL/selection is present but design
context or screenshot access cannot be obtained. Ask for tool access or exported
design evidence. Do not implement from memory, URL metadata, or guessed layout.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is general UI design or visual polish without Figma source context;
  use `frontend-implementation`, `ui-art-direction`, or `ui-quality-gate`.
- The task starts from a screenshot, generated image, mockup image, or visual
  reference that is not Figma design context; use `img-to-frontend`.
- The user wants to create, edit, organize, or write back to the Figma canvas;
  use official Figma tools or plugins when available.
- The user only needs design critique, not repository code implementation.

## Workflow

1. Parse the Figma URL or selected node for file key and node id when needed.
2. Fetch design context. If truncated, fetch metadata first and then the
   smallest relevant child nodes.
3. Capture a screenshot for visual validation.
4. Fetch variables, token definitions, component metadata, and assets when the
   tool exposes them.
5. Inspect the project for existing components, tokens, styling conventions,
   routing, image handling, and verification commands.
6. Translate the design into project-native code. Treat MCP output as design
   evidence, not necessarily final code style.
7. Validate against the screenshot: layout, spacing, typography, color, assets,
   states, responsive behavior, and accessibility.
8. Record any intentional deviation caused by accessibility, technical
   constraints, or project design-system requirements.

## Implementation Rules

- Reuse project components before creating new ones.
- Map Figma variables to project tokens when possible.
- Prefer project design-system consistency unless it materially breaks visual
  parity; document tradeoffs.
- Use real assets from the Figma payload when available. Do not create
  placeholders when the source asset was provided.
- Do not import new icon or UI packages just because the design contains icons.
- Keep components composable and typed where the project uses TypeScript.
- Do not reference nonexistent sibling Figma skills in this repo.

## Validation Checklist

- Design context and screenshot were fetched or the blocker is explicit.
- Required variables/assets were used or a missing-asset note is recorded.
- Layout, alignment, sizing, type, color, and major states match the reference.
- Responsive behavior follows Figma constraints and project breakpoints.
- Accessibility basics are preserved.
- Local lint/test/build or the closest available check was run.

## Output

Return:

- Figma source used: URL/node/selection.
- Evidence fetched: design context, screenshot, variables/assets/components.
- Files changed.
- Component/token mapping summary.
- Parity result, intentional deviations, and missing-source notes.
- Verification commands and results.
