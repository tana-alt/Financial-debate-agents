description: "Use for ordinary React or Next.js UI implementation: components, forms, routing, client state, data wiring, and local loading/error/responsive/accessibility behavior within existing product patterns."
---


## Purpose

Keep frontend changes small, testable, accessible, and consistent with the existing UI architecture.

## Effect

When this skill fires, inspect the existing frontend structure first, implement
the smallest project-native UI change, preserve expected states and
accessibility, and verify the affected route or component with the closest
available check.

## Use when

- Adding or changing UI components.
- Implementing forms, navigation, client state, data wiring, or error/loading states.
- Touching responsive layout or accessibility behavior.

## Do not use when

- The primary task is visual direction, premium composition, brand expression,
  or image-led design; use `ui-art-direction`.
- The task is reviewing or repairing UI quality after a change; use
  `ui-quality-gate`.
- The task starts from a Figma frame, node, selection, or URL; use
  `figma-design-to-code`.
- The task is screenshot/image-to-code or generated visual exploration; use
  `img-to-frontend`.
- The main risk is React/Next performance, server/client boundaries, caching,
  hydration, bundle size, or render frequency; use `react-next-performance`.

## Success conditions

- The component has clear responsibility boundaries.
- Loading, empty, error, and success states are handled when applicable.
- Basic keyboard and screen-reader accessibility are preserved.
- Form validation occurs at the appropriate client/server boundaries.
- Styling follows existing tokens, components, and layout conventions.

## Constraints

- Do not expose secrets, tokens, raw errors, or private data to the client.
- Do not add a new state library or UI library unless necessary.
- Do not perform broad redesign while implementing a local change.
- Do not hide server authorization requirements behind UI-only checks.
- Do not add arbitrary animations or decorative complexity without task need.

## Stop

Stop and route or ask before implementing when the request requires a new design
system, broad redesign, unprovided visual reference, unclear route ownership,
new client-exposed sensitive data, or a framework/version-sensitive API that
needs `doc-lookup`.

## Output

- Frontend surface changed.
- States handled: loading / empty / error / success / disabled as applicable.
- Accessibility and responsive checks performed or not applicable.
- Verification command, browser check, or blocked reason.
- Adjacent skill routed or intentionally not needed.
