name: browser-verification
description: Use when a frontend route, browser flow, visual regression, responsive behavior, console/network error risk, or release-critical user journey needs proof in a real or scripted browser. Choose automated-e2e when tests exist; choose manual-browser-qa for preview/local smoke checks.

# Browser Verification

Use this skill to prove browser behavior, not to redesign the UI.

## Effect

When this skill fires, produce concrete browser evidence for the route or flow
at risk. Verify the specific behavior in a real or scripted browser, check
console/network/viewport concerns when relevant, and report proof or a clear
blocker instead of relying on code inspection alone.

## Modes

### automated-e2e

Use when an existing Playwright or e2e path can verify the target flow, or when
the user explicitly asks for an e2e reproduction.

- Prefer existing e2e tests.
- Add only the smallest deterministic test for the target flow when needed.
- Avoid arbitrary sleeps; use assertions and deterministic waits.
- Report the command, failing step, artifact, and likely implementation area.

### manual-browser-qa

Use when a local app or preview needs a focused smoke check.

- Load the critical route or flow.
- Check console errors and relevant network 4xx/5xx where possible.
- Sample desktop and mobile widths when layout changed.
- Check keyboard basics for forms and controls.
- Avoid production accounts, destructive actions, and unrelated pages.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is ordinary UI implementation without a requested or risk-driven
  browser proof step; use `frontend-implementation`.
- The task is broad pre-merge, release, or handoff verification across multiple
  surfaces; use `release-check`, and include browser verification only for
  browser-risk areas.
- The task is visual polish, accessibility, focus, overflow, or responsive
  quality review without needing browser evidence; use `ui-quality-gate`.
- The task is design direction or visual composition before implementation; use
  `ui-art-direction`.

## Constraints

- Do not inspect every page unless requested.
- Do not create a broad e2e suite during a local task.
- Do not hide flakiness; report it as risk.
- Do not treat cosmetic preference as a release blocker unless it breaks the
  stated goal or accessibility.

## Output

Return:

- mode used: `automated-e2e` or `manual-browser-qa`
- route or flow checked
- viewport/device coverage, if layout or responsiveness was relevant
- console/network findings, if checked
- command/tool and result: pass / fail / blocked; if not run, mark blocked
- artifact path, screenshot, trace, or concise failure summary
- patch made, if any
- residual risk or follow-up verification needed

## Stop Guidance

Stop after proving or disproving the scoped route or flow. Do not expand to
unrelated pages, broad release checks, redesign, or full accessibility audits
unless the user asks or the observed failure makes that scope necessary.
