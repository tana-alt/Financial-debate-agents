# Git Worktree And Branch Reference

Use this reference only for concrete Git branch, worktree, changed-path,
conflict-check, and protected-branch mechanics.

## Trigger

Open this reference when:

- local write work needs branch or worktree isolation, branch naming, worktree
  creation or validation, or protected branch/worktree policy;
- parallel `git_scope` must be checked for completeness, or branch/worktree
  targets must be derived from `work_id`, `lane`, and a short slug;
- changed-path evidence, allowed-write-target checks, sibling-conflict checks,
  or concrete PR-prep mechanics require branch/worktree facts.

Do not open this reference when:

- the task is read-only and asks for wording, review, explanation, or planning
  with no local write, branch, worktree, changed-path, conflict, or PR action;
- the task only needs conceptual parallel-lane scope or handoff boundaries;
- the task only needs verification command choice, fast/full gate choice, CI/PR
  readiness, record templates, evidence schema, repo placement, storage
  boundaries, or migration acceptance.

Adjacent references:

- Use `agent-runtime-and-scope-reference.md` for conceptual parallel lanes,
  scope boundaries, handoff compatibility, and retry/idempotency; do not pair it
  with this reference solely because a concrete local write is in a parallel
  agent lane.
- Use `verification-ci-and-pr-reference.md` for verification command choice,
  fast/full gate choice, CI/PR readiness, result reporting, and human-gate
  notes beyond concrete branch/worktree mechanics.
- Use `packet-evidence-and-rework-reference.md` for work-contract,
  evidence-record, verification-record, and rework-record fields or templates;
  do not open it solely because Git facts will appear in a handoff evidence
  list.
- Use `repo-boundary-and-storage-reference.md` for durable path placement,
  repo truth surfaces, ignored local state, and storage decisions.

Expected effect after opening:

- Derive or validate owned `agent/*` branch and external worktree targets,
  require complete `git_scope` or return rework, run local-write preflight from
  the canonical repo root, check changed paths against allowed write targets,
  check sibling branch conflicts when refs are supplied, and report branch,
  worktree, base, merge target, changed paths, conflict status, and protected
  branch/worktree constraints without adding a record schema unless requested.

## Required Scope For Parallel Work

Parallel work requires a complete `git_scope`. The scope may provide explicit
`branch_target` and `worktree_target`, or provide `work_id`, `lane`,
`base_ref`, and `merge_target` from which targets can be derived.

Required fields:

- `base_ref`: source branch or commit, e.g. `origin/main`
- `merge_target`: target branch or ref for review, e.g. `origin/main`
- `allowed_write_targets`: paths this agent may edit
- `branch_target`: branch owned by this agent, or derivable from `work_id`,
  `lane`, and a short task slug
- `worktree_target`: local worktree path outside the canonical repo root, or
  derivable from `work_id` and `lane`
- `sibling_branch_refs`: optional refs for other parallel lanes
- `conflict_policy`: `no_overlap`, `report_overlap`, or `explicitly_scoped`

If required parallel fields are missing, return rework. Do not invent branch or
worktree ownership.

## Branch And Worktree Naming

Use explicit branch targets from scope when provided.

Single-lane work may use an `agent/<work_id>/<lane>/<slug>` branch in the
canonical repo root. Parallel work must use one branch and one external
worktree per agent.

Project-specific work must stay project-scoped. Include `project_id` in
`work_id` or in explicit branch and worktree targets, and do not share a
worktree across project IDs.

When `FOUNDATION_PROJECT_ID` is set, `scripts/check-agent-worktree-policy.sh`
requires the branch `work_id` to include that project ID. In enforced parallel
worktree mode, the local worktree path must include it too. Placeholder
ownership such as `agent/none/none/none` is invalid.

If the scope provides `work_id`, `lane`, and a short task slug, derive:

```text
agent/<work_id>/<lane>/<short-slug>
../worktrees/<repo>/<work_id>-<lane>
```

Examples:

```text
agent/docs-rebuild-20260506/entrypoint/compact-agents
agent/docs-rebuild-20260506/worktree-policy/git-reference
agent/docs-rebuild-20260506/verification/contract-checks
../worktrees/foundation-development/docs-rebuild-20260506-entrypoint
```

Do not reuse another agent's branch or worktree path.

## Starting Parallel Work

The practical entrypoint is the user request or task packet. Treat any explicit
instruction like "run these in parallel", "split into lanes", or "use separate
worktrees" as `git_scope.mode: parallel`.

For each lane, define:

- `work_id`: shared parallel work identifier
- `lane`: unique lane name
- `base_ref`: source branch or commit
- `merge_target`: review target
- `allowed_write_targets`: lane-owned path prefixes
- `branch_target` and `worktree_target`, or enough fields to derive them
- `conflict_policy` and optional `sibling_branch_refs`

To locally enforce worktree separation, set one of:

```sh
export FOUNDATION_REQUIRE_AGENT_WORKTREE=1
git config foundation.requireAgentWorktree true
```

Clear the config after the parallel run if it was only temporary:

```sh
git config --unset foundation.requireAgentWorktree
```

## Preflight

Run from the canonical repo root:

```sh
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git worktree list
```

Confirm the repo root matches the task scope and the status is clean or fully
understood.

If `base_ref` is not supplied, inspect the remote default branch:

```sh
git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
```

If the base ref cannot be identified, return rework.

Fetch only when allowed by scope or normal local workflow:

```sh
git fetch --prune origin
```

## Create An Isolated Worktree

Do not create worktrees inside tracked repo paths. Run in `bash` with resolved
variables from scope or derivation.

```sh
set -eu

: "${BASE_REF:?set BASE_REF from scope}"
: "${BRANCH_TARGET:?set BRANCH_TARGET from scope}"
: "${WORKTREE_TARGET:?set WORKTREE_TARGET from scope}"

REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
cd "$REPO_ROOT"

git worktree list

if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$BRANCH_TARGET"; then
  echo "branch already exists: $BRANCH_TARGET" >&2
  exit 2
fi

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$WORKTREE_TARGET")"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_TARGET" -b "$BRANCH_TARGET" "$BASE_REF"
cd "$WORKTREE_TARGET"

test "$(git branch --show-current)" = "$BRANCH_TARGET"
git status --short
```

## Write Rules

Before editing, inspect current file contents. Do not edit outside
`allowed_write_targets`.

After editing, list changed files:

```sh
set -eu
: "${BASE_REF:?set BASE_REF from scope}"

{
  git diff --name-only
  git diff --cached --name-only
  git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD
} | sort -u | sed '/^$/d'
```

Every changed path must be inside `allowed_write_targets`. Use this check when
`ALLOWED_WRITE_TARGETS` is a newline-separated list of allowed path prefixes:

```sh
set -eu
: "${BASE_REF:?set BASE_REF from scope}"
: "${ALLOWED_WRITE_TARGETS:?set newline-separated allowed targets}"

changed_paths="$({
  git diff --name-only
  git diff --cached --name-only
  git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD
} | sort -u | sed '/^$/d')"

CHANGED_PATHS="$changed_paths" python - <<'PY'
import os
import sys

allowed = [p.strip().rstrip('/') for p in os.environ['ALLOWED_WRITE_TARGETS'].splitlines() if p.strip()]
changed = [p.strip() for p in os.environ.get('CHANGED_PATHS', '').splitlines() if p.strip()]

bad = []
for path in changed:
    normalized = path.strip().lstrip('./')
    if not any(normalized == a or normalized.startswith(a + '/') for a in allowed):
        bad.append(path)

if bad:
    print('out-of-scope changed paths:', file=sys.stderr)
    for path in bad:
        print(path, file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(4)

print('allowed-write-target check: passed')
PY
```

If the check fails, revert out-of-scope changes or return rework.

## Sibling Conflict Check

When `sibling_branch_refs` are provided, compare changed paths against each
sibling branch. `SIBLING_BRANCH_REFS` is newline-separated.

```sh
set -eu
: "${BASE_REF:?set BASE_REF from scope}"
: "${SIBLING_BRANCH_REFS:?set newline-separated sibling refs}"

tmp_current="$(mktemp)"
tmp_sibling="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$tmp_current" "$tmp_sibling"' EXIT

{
  git diff --name-only
  git diff --cached --name-only
  git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD
} | sort -u | sed '/^$/d' > "$tmp_current"

printf '%s\n' "$SIBLING_BRANCH_REFS" | while IFS= read -r ref; do
  [ -n "$ref" ] || continue
  git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"..."$ref" | sort -u | sed '/^$/d' > "$tmp_sibling"
  overlap="$(comm -12 "$tmp_current" "$tmp_sibling")"
  if [ -n "$overlap" ]; then
    printf 'conflict risk with %s:\n%s\n' "$ref" "$overlap" >&2
    exit 3
  fi
done

printf 'sibling conflict check: passed\n'
```

If sibling refs are not provided, state that sibling conflict detection was
unverified.

## Output Evidence

For write work, report:

- repo root
- branch
- worktree
- base ref
- merge target
- changed paths
- allowed-write-target check result
- sibling conflict check result, or why it was unverified
- verification commands and result states

## Human Gate

Agents may push owned `agent/*` review branches and open or update PRs when
scope, branch/worktree ownership, changed-path evidence, and verification are
clear.

Do not push directly to `main` or `master`. Do not merge; merge is
human-only. Do not delete branches, delete worktrees, deploy, release, or
perform external writes outside the owned review branch or PR unless scope
explicitly allows it or a human approves it.

`FOUNDATION_ALLOW_AGENT_POLICY_BYPASS=1` is a human break-glass escape hatch for
local recovery only. Record why it was used in handoff evidence and do not use
it to push protected branches, merge, or skip review.
