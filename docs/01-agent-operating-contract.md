# Agent Operating Contract

## Purpose
Defines how workers act in this repo. Small, bounded work contracts replace
broad role hierarchy.

## Scope First
Start from the user request, task packet, provided scope, and named
`source_refs`; do not discover scope by reading the whole repo.

Useful scope may include task intent, success criteria, source refs, optional
refs, expected outputs, allowed write targets, denied context, evidence
required, verification required, `git_scope` when writing in parallel,
blockers, open questions, and next action.

Do not invent missing facts, paths, requirements, state, roles, or ownership.

## Context Boundary
- Read named refs first.
- Inspect nearby files only as needed for a safe local change.
- Deny unrelated logs, broad history, archives, runtime state, secret material,
  and past-source material by default.
- If context expands, say why in the output.

## Write Preconditions
Before any local write, confirm allowed write targets, current contents or
absence, canonical repo root, relevant VCS status, and conflict risk.

For parallel work, also confirm complete `git_scope`: `base_ref`,
`merge_target`, allowed write targets, conflict policy, and explicit or
derivable branch and worktree targets. If missing, return rework.

Installed hooks block direct writes to protected branches and non-`agent/*`
branches. Parallel agent work must use one branch and one external worktree per
agent. Do not bypass hooks for agent work.

## Side Effects
Classify work before acting: read-only local, local write, external read/write,
dependency/tooling, infra/deploy, secret-bearing, or irreversible/protected.

External writes, dependency/tooling changes, CI/CD changes, deployment, release,
secret handling, auth, billing, database migration, infrastructure, and
security-sensitive work require explicit approval or human gate.

Do not perform gated work without approval; split approved local work from
blocked/rework items. Record command, target surface, gate status, input/output refs,
and verification or rollback note; canonical human-gate list lives in `docs/02-output-verification-contract.md`.

## Valid Output
A valid output follows `docs/02-output-verification-contract.md` and states
changed paths or artifact refs, evidence refs, verification result, unverified
surfaces, residual risk, and next action.

Return rework when scope, permission, evidence, output shape, or verification is
missing, unsafe, ambiguous, or in conflict with repo truth.
